Mayer’s ‘Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning’. The STS is a highly structured academic system. Through the use of a 9-stage lesson organizational structure, STS is used in every SchoolPage session ensuring better engagement, superior retention and rapid results. STS includes the use of cognitive tools such as Mind Mapping, self-diagnosis tools such as Comfort Boxes, and Learning Outcomes that are highly student centric."

But in reality, most of these centres not only fail to provide proper guidance to students but in recent times, there have been some that have been defrauding students in the name of counseling. To put an end to these malpractices prevalent in Nepal, Education Park has been established with a vision to guide the students till they have achieved what they came for to Education Park.

Thus in this highly competitive business world, making well-informed decisions is crucial to keep an edge over the competition. Gaining admission to the premier schools which students globally aspire for is not an easy task. This seemingly tall order can be fulfilled and the ultimate achieved-if you have the right friend, philosopher and guide. This is exactly where Educare steps in. Graduate, business, law and medical schools have a continuously expanding pool of applicants to choose from, as more students than ever before apply for the edge of a top-notch study experience. Even amazing academic achievements, superb test scores, impressive resumes and the most focused efforts are sometimes not enough.
