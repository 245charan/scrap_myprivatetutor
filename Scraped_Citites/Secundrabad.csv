	Vision Global canvass, local colours that is what we, at Glocal, simply believe in. It is the prism that refracts all our endeavours—whether it is our architecture, curriculum design, pedagogy, hostel life, laboratories, café or the library. In short, we simply celebrate the liminal space where the global meets the local. We are traditional, yet we are not. We are modern, yet we are not really so. We understand the hybrid nature of the global workplace and that is why no binaries constrain us. To flourish in the world today, one cannot afford substantive and rigid visions of the good life. One has to appreciate the negotiated nature of the contemporary. That is why we emphasize reflexivity, flexibility, diversity and accommodation as key values. "
