While there are large numbers of great teachers available throughout the world, great teaching and great tutoring are very different in many ways and require very different approaches. There are many differences between classroom teaching and off-school tutoring methodologies. With this in mind, the School Page team worked with other global academics to create the unique School Page e-Tutoring System (the STS), which is based on Richard E. Mayers Cognitive Theory of Multimedia learning.

The STS is a highly structured academic system. Through the use of a 9-stage lesson organizational structure, STS is used in every SchoolPage session ensuring better engagement, superior retention and rapid results. STS includes the use of cognitive tools such as Mind Mapping, self-diagnosis tools such as Comfort Boxes and learning outcomes that are highly student-centric."
